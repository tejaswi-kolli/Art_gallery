# 🎨 Art Gallery Web Application  

> A full-stack web application designed to manage and display artwork collections using a structured client-server architecture.

---

## 📌 Overview  

The **Art Gallery Web Application** is a full-stack project built to demonstrate backend–frontend integration, modular architecture, and structured data handling.

This project separates concerns between presentation and business logic layers, enabling scalable and maintainable development.

It showcases:

- Client-server communication  
- REST-style routing  
- Modular backend structure  
- Organized frontend components  
- Version-controlled workflow using Git  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  

Static gallery websites lack scalability and dynamic data handling.  

This project was developed to:

- Build a dynamic platform for displaying art collections  
- Separate frontend UI from backend logic  
- Enable structured data flow between client and server  
- Demonstrate maintainable full-stack architecture  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture  

The application follows a **Client–Server Model**.

### 🔹 Frontend Layer
- Handles UI rendering and user interaction  
- Sends requests to backend endpoints  
- Dynamically updates content  

### 🔹 Backend Layer
- Processes incoming requests  
- Implements routing logic  
- Handles business logic and data management  
- Performs validation before responding  

### 🔄 Data Flow
User
->
Frontend (UI)
->
Backend API
->
Data Source
->
Backend Response
->
Frontend Rendering

This structured flow ensures separation of concerns and maintainability.
