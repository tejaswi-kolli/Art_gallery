Art Gallery Web Application
Overview

Art Gallery is a full-stack web application designed to showcase and manage a collection of artworks. The application allows users to browse art pieces, view detailed information, and interact with the gallery through a structured frontend and backend architecture.

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills including backend logic handling, frontend integration, structured routing, and data management.

Problem Statement

Traditional static websites do not provide scalable or dynamic ways to manage art collections. This project was developed to:

Provide a dynamic and interactive platform for displaying artwork

Separate frontend and backend responsibilities

Implement structured data flow between client and server

Demonstrate modular and maintainable code architecture

Architecture Overview

The project follows a client-server model:

Frontend

Responsible for UI rendering and user interaction

Sends requests to backend APIs

Displays dynamic content received from the server

Backend

Handles business logic and request processing

Manages data storage and retrieval

Implements routing and server-side validation

Data Flow:

User → Frontend → Backend API → Database / Data Source → Backend → Frontend → User Interface

Tech Stack

Frontend:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript (if applicable)

Backend:

(Specify your backend tech: Node.js / Python / Express / Flask — update this correctly)

REST-style routing

Database / Data Handling:

(Specify if using MongoDB / MySQL / JSON / etc.)

Version Control:

Git

GitHub

Features

Dynamic rendering of artwork collections

Modular backend routing

Structured API request handling

Separation of concerns between frontend and backend

Clean project folder structure for scalability

Version-controlled development workflow

Engineering Highlights

Designed modular backend architecture to improve maintainability

Implemented structured routing for handling multiple request types

Maintained clean separation between presentation layer and logic layer

Followed Git-based version control practices

Organized codebase into frontend and backend directories for clarity and scalability

How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/tejaswi-kolli/Art_gallery.git

Navigate to backend folder

cd backend

Install dependencies

(npm install OR pip install -r requirements.txt — adjust correctly)

Start the server

(node app.js OR python app.py — adjust correctly)

Open frontend in browser

Navigate to the frontend directory and open index.html
OR run using a local development server.

Future Improvements

Add authentication and role-based access

Deploy to cloud platform (AWS / Render / Railway)

Add containerization using Docker

Implement unit testing for backend routes

Add pagination and search optimization

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

Full-stack development principles

Client-server architecture
